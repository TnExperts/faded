# Faded!

## Client did not pay?
Add opacity to your widgets and decrease it every day until their app completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the app is fully vanished.


```dart
  Faded(
    // Due date should be in yyyy-mm-dd format
    dueDate: '2021-01-15',
    daysDeadline: 12,
    child: MyApp(),
  )
```

And.... Faded! the app is all gone now..
